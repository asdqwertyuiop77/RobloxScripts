# Loadstring

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asdqwertyuiop77/RobloxScripts/main/InfiniteYieldForWave.lua"))()
```

# Disclaimer
This is a modified version of Infinite yield, made by infyiff, Its originally not compatible with wave exector and it just glitches. This is the version that is compatible with wave executor.

### How
Thats really simple, i just removed the json loader that loads settings because the executor itself cannot load json yet, so it automatically uses the fabric settings and doesnt cause a glitch.
